  <p>Heralded as the true living center of dwarven culture on the continent, the stronghold of Kraghammer was established by the surviving families of the high-mountain kingdom of Uthtor, said to have crumbled nearly a millennia ago in the Calamity. Rebuilt by survivors of Uthtor within the southern face of the Cliffkeep Mountains, Kraghammer grew with industrious vigor a few centuries ago with the discovery of rich veins of platinum and mithral, which remain its main source of wealth and trade power. It currently holds its ground as a long-standing autonomous city-state allied with the Council of Tal&rsquo;Dorei, and the instigator of countless expeditions into the Cliffkeeps to extract the riches and long-forgotten secrets beneath the staggering peaks.</p>
  <p>An ominous walk of a thousand stairs climb the side of the mountain to the gates of the city carved from the mountain itself, just wide enough for two dwarves to walk abreast. Too steep and treacherous for carts or common beasts of burden, traders and trappers use giant goats to transport their goods to and from market, while wealthy dwarven merchant lords employ serfs and laborers to carry their goods. Kraghammer&rsquo;s impenetrable adamantine gates stand at the end of a perilous bridge overlooking a hundred-foot chasm, and is guarded by three watchtowers carved into the mountain itself.</p>
  <p>Within those gates, the massive stronghold is made up of three cylindrical levels called &ldquo;slabs&rdquo; that descend deep beneath the mountains. Kraghammer&rsquo;s granite walls are lit by roaring fires, enchanted torches, and shimmering candlerock, which glows with internal fire. Even when the evening fires are extinguished, the amber light of the Bronzegrip Metalworks at the base of the city bathes the city in its warm glow.</p>

  <p id="kgGoverment" class="display-4"><a href="#kgGoverment">Government</a></p>
  <p>Kraghammer law is written by a consortium of the five most powerful houses within the city, each appointing a delegate to serve on their behalf. That tenuous union of houses is kept by the city&rsquo;s executive officer, the Ironkeeper. The Ironkeeper is elected by the houses, carries a term of ten years, with no term limit, though most Ironkeepers rule for between three to five terms. The current sitting Ironkeeper is Gradim Greyspine of House Greyspine, halfway through his third term. His heroics in the recent war have made him beloved of his people, and his softer view of outlanders has made him a champion of the repressed.</p>
  <p>The laws of the city are enforced by a military class of elite warriors called Carvers that act as guards, soldiers, and jailers under the guidance of the Ironkeeper. Becoming a Carver is a lengthy, rigorous, and taxing pursuit, and many who choose to join fail to complete their training and find another career path. As such, many Carvers are brought to it through family tradition, the pressure and expectation of the family name and a father&rsquo;s honor being stronger than personal pain and preference. Once officially named, a Carver is given a homestead built into the center slab of the city, a set of masterwork armor and weapons, and a steady income.</p>

  <p id="kgPrejudice" class="display-4"><a href="#kgPrejudice">Prejudice</a></p>
  <p>No non-dwarf has ever served as a delegate of the
    houses, let alone the Ironkeeper. Though dwarves individually
    are often trusting, honest folk, Kraghammer
    breeds a culture of xenophobia that prevents people
    of other races from participating in the highest levels
    of dwarven society. Even if they were born within
    Kraghammer, their epithet will always be outlander,
    surface-dweller, sun-eyes, or worse. Yet this startlingly
    overt racism seems to melt away for as long as an
    outlander is useful—and no longer. Greed drives Kraghammer;
    it fuels its furnaces and works its bellows, and
    many outlanders within Kraghammer do their best to
    live within its system, trying to eke out a meager living.</p>
  <p>
    The only exception to this xenophobia are the gnomes.
    When the gnomish city of Wittebak was sundered by hill
    giants nearly 400 years ago, the refugees were accepted
    into Kraghammer, bringing their innovative mechanical
    ideas to the growing community and cementing a kinship
    of convenience between the two races. As time passed, the
    partnership has flourished for both parties, and the drive
    to reclaim their old home has since been ever-postponed
    due to procrastination and lack of interest. Still, no gnome
    has ever served as a representative of the Houses, nor as
    Ironkeeper. Some minority peoples within Kraghammer
    are jealous of the gnomes’ place of “honor” within the
    dwarven community and seek to subvert them, while
    others implore the gnomes to use their voice to speak up
    for the outlanders.</p>

  <p id="khCrime" class="display-4"><a href="#khCrime">Crime</a></p>
  <p>Citizens of Emon who visit Kraghammer often marvel at
    how lawful and organized the dwarven enclave is. Crime
    is ostensibly low within Kraghammer thanks to the Carvers’
    protection, but this peace comes at a cost. Corruption
    is rife within the Carvers, and within House Glorenthal,
    their patron house. Because of Glorenthal’s close ties with
    the Carvers, corruption has been hard to uncover within
    either organization. That all changed when a gnomish
    journalist named Ida Mudrake uncovered something
    damning within the Glorenthal vaults. The information
    has not been made public, but a massive trial is on the
    horizon, and the Carvers are in chaos.</p>


  <p id="khGeographyAndClimate" class="display-4">
    <a href="#khGeographyAndClimate">Geography and Climate</a></p>
  <p>Though the Cliffkeep Mountains themselves are blanketed
    in thick snow, the bone-piercing chill does not
    extend into Kraghammer itself. Heat from the Bronzegrip
    Metalworks and the other blast furnaces in the
    Bottom Slab rises and permeates the entire city, though
    the Top Slab still grows cold in the winter. The city itself
    is carved out of the granite core of Mount Kraghammer;
    though the dwarves rarely see the night sky, its walls still
    sparkle like starlight in the amber glow of the furnaces.</p>

  <p id="khTheTopSlab"><a href="#khTheTopSlab"><strong>The Top Slab</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>The Top Slab, also called the Arch, is the entry level
    of the city, built on a massive ring that sends off-shoot
    neighborhoods and tunnels deeper into the mountain
    around it. Here is where most residential life is rooted,
    with thousands of stone-built abodes dotting the walls,
    while popular taverns like the Firebrook Inn and the
    Ironhearth Tavern fill alcoves pushed into the rock. Most
    of the gnomish and non-dwarf population is relegated to a
    neighborhood called the “Otherwalk.” A fine layer of soot
    tends to coat much of this slab, due to imperfect ventilation
    from the industrious center slab.
    As members of the Kraghammer working class, “Topslabbers”
    either make the long commute to labor in the
    Bottom Slab or work in the Toppers’ farms above the
    mountain. Others are indentured servants to wealthy
    dwarves in the Middle Slab, and only return to their families
    on the Top Slab on their monthly day of rest.</p>

  <p id="khTheCenterSlab"><a href="#khTheCenterSlab"><strong>The Center Slab</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>The Center Slab, also referred to as the Heart, marks
    the widest and most varied rung on the journey through
    Kraghammer, and is stratified between the the residences
    of Kraghammer’s dwarven elite and its wealthy
    merchant class. At the exact center of the slab—dwarves
    are very particular about geometrical symbolism—is the
    Pyrethrone, seat of the Ironkeeper. Radiating out from
    the Pyrethrone are the various fortress-manors of the
    dwarven noble houses, with several Carver barracks in
    easy reach.</p>
  <p>Just below, the outer rings of the Center Slab are
    occupied by most of the city’s non-mining businesses,
    from smithies, breweries, and jewelers, to tailors,
    butchers, and even tinkerers like the gnome-run Cracksackle
    Union. The Hunter’s Club is also well known as
    the chief provider for non-imported meats to the city,
    sending parties atop the mountain or in the nearby
    Torian Forest for wild game. The extravagant marble
    temple known as Allhammer’s Will stands on the
    center slab of the city, the grandest of all shrines to
    the most worshiped deity under the mountain. Enormous
    in size and impeccable in detail and architectural
    design, this hall calls artisans and crafters throughout
    the city for inspiration.</p>
  <p>Of the five noble houses, only two conduct their affairs
    entirely in the Center Slab. The magically talented Lord
    Steddos Thunderbrand and his family are known to rarely
    leave their mansion, except on business with the Ironkeeper.
    Wallera Glorenthar used to oversee the combat
    training of all Carvers within Kraghammer, but the scandal
    that rocked her house has called her leadership into
    question. She is currently on leave.</p>

  <p id="khTheBottomSlab"><a href="#khTheBottomSlab"><strong>The Bottom Slab</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>The Bottom Slab, or the Pit, is the industrious center
    of Kraghammer, boasting the most blast furnaces per
    square mile in all of Tal’Dorei, courtesy of the Bronzegrip
    Metalworks and their competitors. The expansive
    Keenstone Quarry is chief among the numerous mining
    operations that have tunneled through the depths of the
    mountains—depths plumbed by Vox Machina early in
    their adventures as they searched for Lady Kima of Vord,
    an adventure that saw them overthrow the duergar of the
    Emberhold and the hateful aberrations of Yug’Voril. A
    network of fungus-farming paths called the Glowgrove
    works its way around this level, passing through all sorts
    of caverns. The mushrooms are harvested by the Toppers,
    the dwarven agricultural league that got their name from
    the small topside farms they tend above the city.</p>
  <p>Three of the five dwarven houses has business interests
    in the Bottom Slab, though they direct its operations
    from the next tier up. Nostoc Greyspine is the grim
    overseer of Keenstone Quarry; he swears that his relationship
    to Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine gives him no
    special privileges. Haddi Bronzegrip is the foredwarf
    of the Bronzegrip Metalworks; she claims to be the
    wealthiest dwarf in the North. Blenton Zuurthom is
    an architectural savant, and one of the older and kinder
    68 Chapter 2: Gazetteer of Tal’Dorei
    tal’dorei campaign guide
    noble dwarves; he tries his best to oversee every major
    construction project in the Bottom Slab.</p>

  <p id="khTheStarshrine"><a href="#khTheStarshrine"><strong>The Starshrine</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>Most dwarves worship the Allhammer, and his teachings of
    community and ancestral piety have been all but completely
    subsumed into Kraghammer’s culture at large. For outlanders
    with different faiths, however, the monolithic religious
    culture can feel inescapable. When the world shook at
    the coming of the Chroma Conclave, tremors rocked the
    upper layers of Kraghammer, causing certain caverns to
    collapse—and in some cases, reveal places of great beauty.
    The Starshrine was established near the Otherwalk inside a
    grotto whose granite walls mysteriously shine with a perfect
    replica of the stars in the night sky. Here, marginalized
    people of all faiths can worship in peace. If a character prays
    to a Good or Neutral deity here, there is a 1% chance per
    character level that their prayer is answered, as the cleric’s
    Divine Intervention feature.</p>

  <p id="khCracksackleHeadquarters"><a href="#khCracksackleHeadquarters"><strong>Cracksackle Headquarters</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>The Gnomish-designed Cracksackle guildhall looks unlike
    anything in Kraghammer. It is made of a dozen glistening
    steel domes, like sleek, metal igloos, and the light of unusual
    experiments flicker through its slitted windows at all hours
    of the night. While intrinsically tied to the Bronzegrip
    Metalworks for resources, contacts, and distribution, the
    Cracksackle gnomes’ inventive contributions to mining and
    masonry technology have made them indispensable to the
    dwarven elite.</p>
  <p>On any working day, a dozen gnomish tinkerers will
    set up shop in the courtyard, selling strange and untested
    devices they have made in their workshops. The GM
    determines which non-magical curiosities can be purchased
    here, but some include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Dynamite (50 gp)</i>, range 30 ft., 4d6 fire damage to
      all creatures and objects in 20 foot radius (DC 12
      Dexterity save for half), detonates at the start of
      the thrower’s next turn after 6-second fuse</li>
    <li><i>Glue bomb (50 gp)</i>, range 30 ft., creatures within
      20 foot radius must make a DC 12 Strength or
      Dexterity saving throw (target’s choice) or be
      restrained. A creature may make another DC 12
      Strength check as an action to escape.</li>
    <li><i>Stink bomb (25 gp)</i>, range 30 ft., creatures within
      20 foot radius must make a DC 12 Constitution
      saving throw or be poisoned for 1d6 rounds, detonates
      after 6-second fuse</li>
    <li><i>Wind glider (200 gp)</i>, requires 1 minute to harness.
      While harnessed and falling, the bearer falls at
      30 feet per round, and the wind glider carries the
      bearer 40 feet in a line each round until they land.
      You can change direction each round. While harnessed,
      your movement is halved, and you have
      disadvantage on attack rolls. A wind glider has an
      AC of 10, and 5 hit points.</li>
  </ul>

  <p id="khHallofBurningMushrooms"><a href="#khHallofBurningMushrooms"><strong>Hall of Burning Mushrooms</strong></a></p>
  <hr class="border-primary"/>
  <p>The Bronzegrip Metalworks just carved deeper into the
    mountain to expand their furnaces, only to discover the
    most magnificent cavern; a mile-wide cave filled with
    bioluminescent purple mushrooms. Industry had to move
    in, and the Bronzegrips hired Wyrmhide Thunderbrand
    and his pyromancer brigade to torch the cavern. The
    mushrooms never stopped burning, and the myconoids
    that lived in the fungal forest never stopped fighting. PCs
    known within Kraghammer may be requested by House
    Bronzegrip or Thunderbrand to cut through the inferno
    and destroy the myconoid monarch.</p>
